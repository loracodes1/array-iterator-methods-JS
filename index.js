// Imagine that we have a collection of Flatbook user objects in an array:

const users = [
    {
      firstName: "Niky",
      lastName: "Morgan",
      favoriteColor: "Blue",
      favoriteAnimal: "Jaguar",
      personalQuote: "You're never too old to learn something new",
    },
    {
      firstName: "Tracy",
      lastName: "Lum",
      favoriteColor: "Yellow",
      favoriteAnimal: "Penguin",
      personalQuote: "I just got lost in thought - it was unfamiliar territory",
    },
    {
      firstName: "Josh",
      lastName: "Rowley",
      favoriteColor: "Blue",
      favoriteAnimal: "Penguin",
      personalQuote: "Always remember you’re unique, just like everyone else",
    },
    {
      firstName: "Kate",
      lastName: "Travers",
      favoriteColor: "Red",
      favoriteAnimal: "Jaguar",
      personalQuote: "Behind every great man is a woman rolling her eyes",
    },
    {
      firstName: "Avidor",
      lastName: "Turkewitz",
      favoriteColor: "Blue",
      favoriteAnimal: "Penguin",
      personalQuote:
        "You don’t have to see the whole staircase, just take the first step",
    },
    {
      firstName: "Drew",
      lastName: "Price",
      favoriteColor: "Yellow",
      favoriteAnimal: "Elephant",
      personalQuote:
        "Failure is not the opposite of success: it’s part of success",
    },
  ];

//   We can iterate over that collection and print out everyone's first name as follows:
function firstNamePrinter(collection) {
    for (const user of collection) {
      console.log(user.firstName);
      console.log(user.personalQuote)
    }
  }

  firstNamePrinter(users);
